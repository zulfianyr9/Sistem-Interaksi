# **1.5 The Process of Interaction Design**

The process of interaction design involves four basic activities:

1. Establishing requirements
   
2. Designing alternatives
   
3. Prototyping
   
4. Evaluating.

<div style="text-align: justify">
These activities are intended to inform one another and to be repeated. For example, measuring the usability of what has been built in
terms of whether it is easy to use provides feedback that certain changes must be made or that certain requirements have not yet been
met. Eliciting responses from potential users about what they think and feel about what has been designed, in terms of its appeal,
touch, engagement, usefulness, and so on, can help explicate the nature of the user experience that the product evokes.

Evaluating what has been built is very much at the heart of interaction design. Its focus is on ensuring that the product is appropriate. It
is usually addressed through a user-centered approach to design, which, as the name suggests, seeks to involve users throughout
the design process. There are many different ways of achieving this: for example, through observing users, talking to them, interviewing
them, modeling their performance, asking them to fill in questionnaires, and even asking them to become co-designers. The findings
from the different ways of engaging and eliciting knowledge from users are then interpreted with respect to ongoing design activities
(we give more detail about all these aspects of evaluation in Chapters 13 to 15).

Equally important as involving users when evaluating an interactive product is understanding what people do. Chapters 3, 4, and 5
explain in detail how people act and interact with one another, with information, and with various technologies, together with describing
their abilities, emotions, needs, desires, and what causes them to get annoyed, frustrated, lose patience, and get bored. Such
knowledge can greatly help designers determine which solutions to choose from the many design alternatives available, and how to
develop and test these further. Chapter 10 describes how an understanding of people and what they do can be translated to
requirements, while Chapters 9 and 11 discuss how to involve users effectively in the design process.

A main reason for having a better understanding of people in the contexts in which they live, work, and learn is that it can help designers
understand how to design interactive products that will fit those niches. A collaborative planning tool for a space mission, intended to be
used by teams of scientists working in different parts of the world, will have quite different needs from one targeted at customer and
sales agents, to be used in a furniture store to draw up kitchen layout plans. Understanding the differences between people can also
help designers appreciate that one size does not fit all; what works for one user group may be totally inappropriate for another. For
example, children have different expectations than adults about how they want to learn or play. They may find having interactive quizzes
and cartoon characters helping them along to be highly motivating, whereas most adults find them annoying. Conversely, adults often
like talking-heads discussions about topics, but children find them boring. Just as everyday objects like clothes, food, and games are
designed differently for children, teenagers, and adults, so interactive products should be designed for different kinds of user.

Learning more about people and what they do can also reveal incorrect assumptions that designers may have about particular user
groups and what they need. For example, it is often assumed that because of deteriorating vision and dexterity, old people want things
to be big – be it text or graphical elements appearing on a screen or the physical controls, like dials and switches, used to control
devices. This may be true for some old people, but studies have shown that many people in their 70s, 80s, and older are perfectly
capable of interacting with standard-size information and even small interfaces, e.g. cell phones, just as well as those in their teens
and 20s, even though, initially, some might think they will find it difficult (Siek et al, 2005). It is increasingly the case that as people get
older, they do not like to consider themselves as lacking in cognitive and manual skills. Being aware of people's sensitivities is as
important as knowing how to design for their capabilities.

Being aware of cultural differences is also an important concern for interaction design, particularly for products intended for a diverse
range of user groups from different countries. An example of a cultural difference is the dates and times used in different countries. In
the USA, for example, the date is written as month, day, year (e.g. 05/21/15) whereas in other countries it is written in the sequence of
day, month, year (e.g. 21/05/15). This can cause problems to designers when deciding on the format of online forms, especially if
intended for global use. It is also a concern for products that have time as a function, e.g. operating systems, digital clocks, car
dashboards. Which cultural group do they give preference to? How do they alert users to the format that is set as default? This raises
the question of how easily an interface designed for one user group can be used and accepted by another (Callahan, 2005). Moreover,
why is it that certain products, like the iPod, are universally accepted by people from all parts of the world, whereas websites are
designed differently and reacted to differently by people from different cultures?

As well as there being standard differences in the way cultures communicate and represent information, designers from different
cultures (that can be cross- or within-country) will often use different form factors, images, and graphical elements when creating
products and dialog features for an interface. This can take the form of contrasting designs, where different colors, types of images,
and structuring of information are used to appeal to people in different countries (see Figure 1.7).

# **BOX 1.2**

**Accessibility**

Accessibility refers to the degree to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible. A focus is on
people with disabilities.

But what does it mean to be disabled? Definitions vary, but the following captures the main points. People are considered to be
disabled if:
<ul>
<li> They have a mental or physical impairment.
<li> The impairment has an adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
<li> The adverse effect is substantial and long term (meaning it has lasted for 12 months, or is likely to last for more than 12
months or for the rest of their life).
</ul>
Whether or not a person is considered to be disabled changes over time with age, or as recovery from an accident progresses.
In addition, the severity and impact of an impairment can vary over the course of a day or in different environmental conditions.

It is quite common, when people first consider the topic of accessibility and interaction design, to consider it largely in terms of a
specific physical disability, such as the inability to walk or being visually impaired. However, it can often be the case that a person
will have more than one disability. There is a wide range of disabilities including:
<ul>
<li> Color-blindness: The inability to distinguish between two colors affects approximately 1 in 10 men and 1 in 200 women. This
has an impact on the use of color for highlighting or distinguishing interface elements.
<li> Dyslexia: Although usually associated with difficulties in reading and writing, there are many different forms of dyslexia, some
of which affect the way in which people comprehend the totality of concepts. A relatively simple interaction design decision
that can cause difficulties for people with dyslexia is the contrast between foreground and background text or images.
<li> Physical impairments: These range from conditions such as tremor or shaking, weakness, pain, reduced control of limbs,
inability to sit upright, to short or missing limbs.
</ul>
Quesenbery (2009) comments on how accessibility is often considered as making sure there aren't any barriers to access for
assistive technologies but without regard to usability, while usability usually targets everyone who uses a site or product, without
considering people who have disabilities. The challenge is to create a good user experience for people with disabilities that is
both accessible and usable.

# **1.6 Interaction Design and the User Experience**

Part of the process of understanding users is to be clear about the primary objective of developing an interactive product for them. Is it
to design an efficient system that will allow them to be highly productive in their work, or is it to design a learning tool that will be
challenging and motivating, or is it something else? To help identify the objectives we suggest classifying them in terms of usability and
user experience goals. Traditionally, usability goals have been viewed as being concerned with meeting specific usability criteria, e.g.
efficiency, whereas, more recently, user experience goals have been concerned with explicating the nature of the user experience, e.g.
to be aesthetically pleasing. It is important to note, however, that the distinction between the two types of goal is not clear-cut, since
usability is fundamental to the quality of the user experience and, conversely, aspects of the user experience, such as how it feels and
looks, are inextricably linked with how usable the product is. We distinguish between them here to help clarify their roles but stress the
importance of considering them together when designing for a user experience. Also, historically, HCI was concerned primarily with
usability (known as usability engineering) but has since become concerned with understanding, designing for, and evaluating a wider
range of user experience aspects.

# **1.6.1 Usability Goals**

Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. It
involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their activities at work, at school,
and in their everyday lives. More specifically, usability is broken down into the following goals:
<ul>
<li> effective to use (effectiveness)
<li> efficient to use (efficiency)
<li> safe to use (safety)
<li> having good utility (utility)
<li> easy to learn (learnability)
<li> easy to remember how to use (memorability).
</ul>
Usability goals are typically operationalized as questions. The purpose is to provide the interaction designer with a concrete means of
assessing various aspects of an interactive product and the user experience. Through answering the questions, designers can be alerted very early on in the design process to potential design problems and conflicts that they might not have considered. However,
simply asking ‘is the system easy to learn?’ is not going to be very helpful. Asking about the usability of a product in a more detailed way
– for example, ‘how long will it take a user to figure out how to use the most basic functions for a new smartwatch; how much can they
capitalize on from their prior experience; and how long would it take a user to learn the whole set of functions?’ – will elicit far more
information. Below we give a description of each goal and a question for each one.
<ul>
<li> Effectiveness is a very general goal and refers to how good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do.
</ul>
Question: Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information they need, or buy the
goods they want?
<ul>
<li> Efficiency refers to the way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks. The marble answering machine described at the
beginning of this chapter was considered efficient in that it let the user carry out common tasks, e.g. listening to messages, through
a minimal number of steps. In contrast, the voice mail system was considered inefficient because it required the user to carry out
many steps and learn an arbitrary set of sequences for the same common task. This implies that an efficient way of supporting
common tasks is to let the user use single button or key presses. An example of where this kind of efficiency mechanism has been
employed effectively is in online shopping. Once users have entered all the necessary personal details in an online form to make a
purchase, they can let the website save all their personal details. Then, if they want to make another purchase at that site, they don't
have to re-enter all their personal details again. A highly successful mechanism patented by Amazon.com is the one-click option,
which requires users only to click a single button when they want to make another purchase.
</ul>
Question: Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their 
tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity?
<ul>
<li> Safety involves protecting the user from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations. In relation to the first ergonomic aspect, it
refers to the external conditions where people work. For example, where there are hazardous conditions – such as X-ray machines
or toxic chemicals – operators should be able to interact with and control computer-based systems remotely. The second aspect
refers to helping any kind of user in any kind of situation avoid the dangers of carrying out unwanted actions accidentally. It also
refers to the perceived fears users might have of the consequences of making errors and how this affects their behavior. To make
interactive products safer in this sense involves (i) preventing the user from making serious errors by reducing the risk of wrong
keys/buttons being mistakenly activated (an example is not placing the quit or delete-file command right next to the save command
on a menu) and (ii) providing users with various means of recovery should they make errors. Safe interactive systems should
engender confidence and allow the user the opportunity to explore the interface to try out new operations (see Figure 1.8a). Other
safety mechanisms include undo facilities and confirmatory dialog boxes that give users another chance to consider their intentions
(a well-known example is the appearance of a dialog box, after issuing the command to delete everything in the trashcan, saying:
‘Are you sure you want to remove all the items in the Trash permanently?’ – see Figure 1.8b).
</ul>

Question: What is the range of errors that are possible using the product and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily
from them?
<ul>
<li> Utility refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to
do. An example of a product with high utility is an accounting software package that provides a powerful computational tool that
accountants can use to work out tax returns. An example of a product with low utility is a software drawing tool that does not allow
users to draw freehand but forces them to use a mouse to create their drawings, using only polygon shapes.
</ul>
Question: Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all their tasks in the way they want
to do them?
<ul>
<li> Learnability refers to how easy a system is to learn to use. It is well known that people don't like spending a long time learning how
to use a system. They want to get started straight away and become competent at carrying out tasks without too much effort. This is
especially so for interactive products intended for everyday use (e.g. social media, email, GPS) and those used only infrequently
(e.g. online tax forms). To a certain extent, people are prepared to spend longer learning more complex systems that provide a wider
range of functionality, like web authoring tools. In these situations, pop-up tutorials can help by providing contextualized step-by-step
material with hands-on exercises. A key concern is determining how much time users are prepared to spend learning a product. It
seems a waste if a product provides a range of functionality that the majority of users are unable or not prepared to spend time
learning how to use.
</ul>
Question: Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying out certain actions? How
hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way?
<ul>
<li>Memorability refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned. This is especially important for interactive
products that are used infrequently. If users haven't used an operation for a few months or longer, they should be able to remember
or at least rapidly be reminded how to use it. Users shouldn't have to keep relearning how to carry out tasks. Unfortunately, this
tends to happen when the operations required to be learned are obscure, illogical, or poorly sequenced. Users need to be helped to
remember how to do tasks. There are many ways of designing the interaction to support this. For example, users can be helped to
remember the sequence of operations at different stages of a task through meaningful icons, command names, and menu options.
Also, structuring options and icons so they are placed in relevant categories of options, e.g. placing all the drawing tools in the
same place on the screen, can help the user remember where to look to find a particular tool at a given stage of a task.
Question: What kinds of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for products
and operations they use infrequently?
</ul>

As well as couching usability goals in terms of specific questions, they are turned into usability criteria. These are specific objectives
that enable the usability of a product to be assessed in terms of how it can improve (or not) a user's performance. Examples of
commonly used usability criteria are time to complete a task (efficiency), time to learn a task (learnability), and the number of errors
made when carrying out a given task over time (memorability). These can provide quantitative indicators of the extent to which
productivity has increased, or how work, training, or learning have been improved. They are also useful for measuring the extent to
which personal, public, and home-based products support leisure and information-gathering activities. However, they do not address
the overall quality of the user experience, which is where user experience goals come into play.

# **1.6.2 User Experience Goals**

A diversity of user experience goals has been articulated in interaction design, which cover a range of emotions and felt experiences.
These include desirable and undesirable ones, as shown in **Table 1.1.**








Many of these are subjective qualities and are concerned with how a system feels to a user. They differ from the more objective usability
goals in that they are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their perspective, rather than assessing how
useful or productive a system is from its own perspective. Whereas the terms used to describe usability goals comprise a small
distinct set, many more terms are used to describe the multifaceted nature of the user experience. They also overlap with what they are
referring to. In so doing, they offer subtly different options for expressing the way an experience varies for the same activity over time,
technology, and place. For example, we may describe listening to music in the shower as highly pleasurable, but consider it more apt
to describe listening to music in the car as enjoyable. Similarly, listening to music on a high-end powerful music system may invoke
exciting and emotionally fulfilling feelings, while listening to it on an iPod Shuffle may be serendipitously enjoyable, especially not
knowing what tune is next. The process of selecting terms that best convey a user's feelings, state of being, emotions, sensations, and
so forth when using or interacting with a product at a given time and place can help designers understand the multifaceted and
changing nature of the user experience.

# **Activity 1.3**

There are more desirable than undesirable aspects of the user experience listed in Table 1.1. Why do you think this is so?

**Comment**

The two lists we have come up with are not meant to be exhaustive. There are likely to be more – both desirable and undesirable
– as new products surface. The reason for there being more of the former is that a primary goal of interaction design is to create
positive experiences. There are many ways of achieving this.

Similar to usability goals, user experience concepts are most useful when turned into specific questions. For example, when
considering how engaging an interactive virtual agent is for an online store, one can ask:

*How long do users interact with the virtual sales agent? Do they suspend their disb elief when typing in questions?*

To consider the effect of its appeal one can ask:

*What is the user's immediate response to the agent's appearance? Is it one of mockery, dismay, or enjoyment? Do they
smile, laugh, or scoff?*

The concepts can be further defined in terms of elements that contribute to making a user experience pleasurable, fun, exciting,
etc. They include attention, pace, play, interactivity, conscious and unconscious control, style of narrative, and flow. The concept of
flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997) is popular in interaction design for informing the design of user experiences for websites, video
games, and other interactive products. It refers to a state of intense emotional involvement that comes from being completely
involved in an activity, like playing music, and where time flies. Instead of designing web interfaces to cater for visitors who know
what they want, they can be designed to induce a state of flow, leading the visitor to some unexpected place, where they become
completely absorbed. In an interview with Wired magazine, Csikszentmihalyi (1996) uses the analogy of a gourmet meal to
describe how a user experience can be designed to be engrossing, “starting off with the appetizers, moving on to the salads and
entrées, and building toward dessert and not knowing what will follow.”

Those working in the computer games industry have acknowledged for a long time that there is an important relationship
between pleasure and usability. Counter-intuitively, they also realized it can work in a negative direction. Many gamers enjoy and
find most challenging non-easy video games, which contravene usability goals (Frohlich and Murphy, 1999). Banging a plastic
hammer to hit a virtual nail represented on the computer screen, compared with using a more efficient way to do the same thing,
e.g. selecting an option using command keys, may require more effort and be more error-prone but can result in a much more
enjoyable and fun experience.

Not all usability and user experience goals will be relevant to the design and evaluation of an interactive product being
developed. Some combinations will also be incompatible. For example, it may not be possible or desirable to design a process
control system that is both safe and fun. Recognizing and understanding the nature of the relationship between usability and
other user experience goals is central to interaction design. It enables designers to become aware of the consequences of
pursuing different combinations when designing products and highlight potential trade-offs and conflicts. As suggested by
Carroll (2004), articulating the interactions of the various components of the user's experience can lead to a deeper and more
significant interpretation of the role of each component.

# **BOX 1.3**

**Beyond usability: designing to persuade**

Schaffer (2009) argues that we should be focusing more on the user experience and less on usability. He points out how many
websites are designed to persuade or influence rather than enable users to perform their tasks in an efficient manner. For
example, many online shopping sites are in the business of selling services and products, where a core strategy is to entice
people to buy what they might not have thought they needed. Online shopping experiences are increasingly about persuading
people to buy rather than being designed to make shopping easy. This involves designing for persuasion, emotion, and trust –
which may or may not be compatible with usability goals.

This entails determining what customers will do, whether it is to make a donation, buy a product, or renew a membership and
involves encouraging, suggesting, or reminding the user of things they might like or need. Many online travel sites try to lure
visitors to purchase additional items (such as hotels, insurance, car rental, car parking, day trips) besides the flight they went to
book originally and will add a list full of tempting graphics to the visitor's booking form, which they have to scroll through before
being able to complete their transaction. These persuasion opportunities need to be designed to be eye-catching and enjoyable
– in the same way an array of products are attractively laid out in the aisles of a grocery store that one is required to walk past
before reaching one's desired product. Some online sites, however, have gone too far; for example, adding items to the
customer's shopping basket (e.g. insurance, special delivery) that the shopper has to deselect if not wanted. This sneaky addon
approach can often result in a negative experience. More generally, this deceptive approach to UX has been described by
Harry Brignull as ‘dark patterns’ (see http://darkpatterns.org/). Shoppers often become annoyed if they notice decisions, that cost
money, have been made on their behalf without them even being asked (see Figure 1.9). The key is to nudge people in subtle
and pleasant ways that they can trust and feel comfortable with.
