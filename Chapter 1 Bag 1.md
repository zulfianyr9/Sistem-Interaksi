# **1.1 Introduction**
How many interactive products are there in everyday use? Think for a minute about what you use in a typical day: smartphone, tablet,
computer, remote control, coffee machine, ATM, ticket machine, printer, iPod, GPS, e-reader, TV, electric toothbrush, radio, games
console . . . the list is endless. Now think for a minute about how usable they are. How many are actually easy, effortless, and enjoyable
to use? Some, like the iPod, are a joy to use. Others, like a ticket machine, can be very frustrating. Why is there a difference?

Many products that require users to interact with them, such as smartphones and social networking sites, have been designed
primarily with the user in mind. They are generally easy and enjoyable to use. Others, such as switching from viewing a rented movie
on your smart TV to watching a sports channel, or setting the alarm on a digital clock, have not necessarily been designed with the
users in mind, but have been engineered primarily as systems to perform set functions. While they may work effectively, it can be at the
expense of how they will be used by real people.

One main aim of interaction design is to reduce the negative aspects (e.g. frustration, annoyance) of the user experience while
enhancing the positive ones (e.g. enjoyment, engagement). In essence, it is about developing interactive products1 that are easy,
effective, and pleasurable to use – from the users’ perspective. In this chapter we begin by examining what interaction design is. We
look at the difference between good and poor design, highlighting how products can differ radically in how usable and enjoyable they
are. We then describe what and who is involved in the process of interaction design. The user experience, which is a central concern of
interaction design, is then introduced. Finally, we outline how to characterize the user experience in terms of usability goals, user
experience goals, and design principles. An assignment is presented at the end of the chapter in which you have the opportunity to put
into practice what you have read by evaluating the design of an interactive product.

# **1.2 Good and Poor Design**
A central concern of interaction design is to develop interactive products that are usable. By this is generally meant easy to learn,
effective to use, and providing an enjoyable user experience. A good place to start thinking about how to design usable interactive
products is to compare examples of well- and poorly-designed ones. Through identifying the specific weaknesses and strengths of
different interactive products, we can begin to understand what it means for something to be usable or not. Here, we describe two
examples of poorly designed products – a voice mail system used in hotels and the ubiquitous remote control device – and contrast
these with two well-designed examples of products that perform the same function.

*(1) Voice Mail System*

Imagine the following scenario. You are staying at a hotel for a week while on a business trip. You discover you have left your cell phone
at home so you have to rely on the hotel's facilities. The hotel has a voice mail system for each room. To find out if you have a message,
you pick up the handset and listen to the tone. If it goes ‘beep, beep, beep’ there is a message. To find out how to access the message
you have to read a set of instructions next to the phone. You read and follow the first step:
<ul>
‘1. Touch 41.’

The system responds: ‘You have reached the Sunny Hotel voice message center. Please enter the room number for which you
would like to leave a message.’

You wait to hear how to listen to a recorded message. But there are no further instructions from the phone. You look down at the
instruction sheet again and read:

‘2. Touch*, your room number, and #.’

You do so and the system replies: ‘You have reached the mailbox for room 106. To leave a message, type in your password.’
</ul>
You type in the room number again and the system replies: ‘Please enter room number again and then your password.’

You don't know what your password is. You thought it was the same as your room number, but clearly it's not. At this point you give up
and call reception for help. The person at the desk explains the correct procedure for recording and listening to messages. This
involves typing in, at the appropriate times, the room number and the extension number of the phone (the latter is the password, which
is different from the room number). Moreover, it takes six steps to access a message and five steps to leave a message. You go out
and buy a new cell phone.

What is problematic with this voice mail system?
<ul>
<li> It is infuriating.
<li> It is confusing.
<li> It is inefficient, requiring you to carry out a number of steps for basic tasks.
<li> It is difficult to use.
<li> It has no means of letting you know at a glance whether any messages have been left or how many there are. You have to pick up
the handset to find out and then go through a series of steps to listen to them.
<li> It is not obvious what to do: the instructions are provided partially by the system and partially by a card beside the phone.
</ul>

Now consider the following phone answering machine. **Figure 1.1** shows two small sketches of an answering machine phone.
Incoming messages are represented using physical marbles. The number of marbles that have moved into the pinball-like chute
indicates the number of messages. Dropping one of these marbles into a slot in the machine causes the recorded message to play.
Dropping the same marble into another slot on the phone dials the caller who left the message.

How does the marble answering machine differ from the voice mail system?
<ul>
<li> It uses familiar physical objects that indicate visually at a glance how many messages have been left.
<li> It is aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable to use.
<li> It only requires one-step actions to perform core tasks.
<li> It is a simple but elegant design.
<li> It offers less functionality and allows anyone to listen to any of the messages.
</ul>
The marble answering machine is considered a design classic and was designed by Durrell Bishop while he was a student at the
Royal College of Art in London (described by Crampton Smith, 1995). One of his goals was to design a messaging system that
represented its basic functionality in terms of the behavior of everyday objects. To do this, he capitalized on people's everyday
knowledge of how the physical world works. In particular, he made use of the ubiquitous everyday action of picking up a physical object
and putting it down in another place. This is an example of an interactive product designed with the users in mind. The focus is on
providing them with an enjoyable experience but one that also makes efficient the activity of receiving messages. However, it is
important to note that although the marble answering machine is a very elegant and usable design, it would not be practical in a hotel
setting. One of the main reasons is that it is not robust enough to be used in public places: for instance, the marbles could easily get
lost or be taken as souvenirs. Also, the need to identify the user before allowing the messages to be played is essential in a hotel
setting. When considering the design of an interactive product, therefore, it is important to take into account where it is going to be used
and who is going to use it. The marble answering machine would be more suited in a home setting – provided there were no children
who might be tempted to play with the marbles!

*(2) Remote Control Device*

Every home entertainment system, be it the TV, cable, smart TV, music system, and so forth, comes with its own remote control device.
Each one is different in terms of how it looks and works. Many have been designed with a dizzying array of small, multicolored, and
double-labeled buttons (one on the button and one above or below it) that often seem arbitrarily positioned in relation to one another.
Many viewers, especially when sitting in their living room, find it difficult to locate the right ones, even for the simplest of tasks, like
pausing or finding the main menu. It can be especially frustrating for those who need to put on their reading glasses each time to read
the buttons. The remote control device appears to have been put together very much as an afterthought.

In contrast, much effort and thought went into the design of the TiVo remote control. The buttons were large, clearly labeled, and logically
arranged, making them easy to locate and use in conjunction with the menu interface that appears on the TV monitor. In terms of its
physical form, the remote device was designed to fit into the palm of a hand, having a peanut shape. It also has a playful look and feel
about it: colorful buttons and cartoon icons were used that are very distinctive, making it easy to identify them in the dark and without
having to put reading glasses on.

How was it possible to create such a usable and appealing remote device where so many others have failed? The answer is simple:
TiVo invested the time and effort to follow a user-centered design process. Specifically, TiVo's director of product design at the time
involved potential users in the design process, getting their feedback on everything from the feel of the device in the hand to where best
to place the batteries – making them easy to replace but not prone to falling out. He and his design team also resisted the trap of
‘buttonitis’ – to which so many other remote controls have fallen victim – where buttons breed like rabbits, one for every new function.
They did this by restricting the number of control buttons embedded in the device to the essential ones. Other functions were then
represented as part of the menu options and dialog boxes displayed on the TV screen, which could be selected via the core set of
physical control buttons. The result was a highly usable and pleasing device that has received much praise and numerous design
awards.

# **Dilemma**
# **What is the best way to interact with a smart TV?**

A challenge facing Smart TV providers is how to enable users to interact with online content such that it can still be as easy and
enjoyable to do as it was with previous generations of TV, with a remote control device. Viewers can now select a whole range of
content via their TV screens, but it also involves having to type in passwords and search terms, while scrolling through lots of
menus, etc. In many ways it has become more like a computer than a TV. This raises the question of whether the remote control
is the best input device to use for someone who is sat on a sofa or chair that is some distance from the TV wide screen. Another
possibility is to add a keyboard and touch pad to the remote for menu/icon selection and text input. However, this can be clunky
and awkward to use, especially with only one hand. An alternative is to provide an on-screen keyboard and number pad – as
Apple TV has done (see **Figure 1.2**). It has designed a slimline remote device that controls the cursor on the TV screen.
However, to type requires pecking at a grid of alphanumeric letters/numbers that is not the same as the conventional QWERTY
keyboard on phones and computers. This style of interaction can be painstakingly slow; it is also easy to overshoot and select
the wrong letter or number. Another option is to download an app onto a smartphone and interact with the keypad as if texting.
But the app has to be opened each time to act as ‘a remote’ and is only as good as the person whose smartphone it is.

Might there be a better way to choose between thousands of films or send an email whilst sat on the sofa using the TV?

One innovative solution is Minuum's new keyboard that works a bit like a Wii remote, except that you point at an online staggered
line keyboard to select characters. This layout seems more intuitive and faster to use on a small device, especially with one
hand.

# **1.2.1 What to Design**

Designing interactive products requires considering who is going to be using them, how they are going to be used, and where they are
going to be used. Another key concern is to understand the kind of activities people are doing when interacting with the products. The
appropriateness of different kinds of interfaces and arrangements of input and output devices depends on what kinds of activities are to
be supported. For example, if the activity is to enable people to bank online, then an interface that is secure, trustworthy, and easy to
navigate is essential. In addition, an interface that allows the user to find out new information about the services offered by the bank
without it being intrusive would be useful.

The world is becoming suffused with technologies that support increasingly diverse activities. Just think for a minute what you can
currently do using computer-based systems: send messages, gather information, write essays, control power plants, program, draw,
plan, calculate, monitor others, play games – to name but a few. Now think about the types of interfaces and interactive devices that are
available. They, too, are equally diverse: multitouch displays, speech-based systems, handheld devices, and large interactive displays
– to name but a few. There are also many ways of designing how users can interact with a system, e.g. via the use of menus,
commands, forms, icons, gestures, etc. Furthermore, ever more innovative everyday artifacts are being created, using novel materials,
such as e-textiles and wearables (see **Figure 1.3**).

The interfaces for everyday consumer items, like cameras, microwave ovens, and washing machines, that used to be physical and the
realm of product design, are now predominantly digitally based, requiring interaction design (called consumer electronics). The move
towards transforming human–human transactions into solely interface-based ones has also introduced a new kind of customer
interaction. Self-checkouts at grocery stores, airports, and libraries are becoming the norm where customers themselves have to check
in their own goods, luggage, or books. Instead of a friendly face helping them out, interfaces bark orders at them. While more costeffective,
it puts the onus on the users to interact with the system. Accidentally pressing the wrong button can result in a frustrating, and
sometimes mortifying, experience, especially for first-time users.
What this all amounts to is a multitude of choices and decisions that interaction designers have to make for an ever-increasing range
of products. A key question for interaction design is: how do you optimize the users’ interactions with a system, environment, or product,
so that they support and extend the users’ activities in effective, useful, and usable ways? One could use intuition and hope for the best.
Alternatively, one can be more principled in deciding which choices to make by basing them on an understanding of the users. This
involves:
