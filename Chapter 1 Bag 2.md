# **1.3 What Is Interaction Design?**
By interaction design, we mean

*designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.*

Put another way, it is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact.
More generally, Winograd describes it as “designing spaces for human communication and interaction” (1997, p. 160). Thackara views
it as “the why as well as the how of our daily interactions using computers” (2001, p. 50) while Saffer emphasizes its artistic aspects:

“the art of facilitating interactions between humans through products and services” (2010, p. 4).

A number of terms have been used to emphasize different aspects of what is being designed, including user interface design, software
design, user-centered design, product design, web design, experience design, and interactive system design. Interaction design is
increasingly being accepted as the umbrella term, covering all of these aspects. Indeed, many practitioners and designers, who in the
1990s would have described what they were doing as interface design or interactive system design, now promote what they are doing
as interaction design.

The focus of interaction design is very much concerned with practice, i.e. how to design user experiences. It is not wedded to a
particular way of doing design, but is more eclectic, promoting the use of a range of methods, techniques, and frameworks. Which is
given prominence or is currently in vogue will very much depend on the time and context (Lowgren and Stolterman, 2004; Saffer, 2010).

How does interaction design differ from other approaches to the design of computer-based systems, such as software engineering? A
simple analogy to another profession, concerned with creating buildings, may clarify this difference. In his account of interaction design,
Winograd (1997) asks how architects and civil engineers differ when faced with the problem of building a house. Architects are
concerned with the people and their interactions with each other and with the house being built. For example, is there the right mix of
family and private spaces? Are the spaces for cooking and eating in close proximity? Will people live in the space being designed in the
way it was intended to be used? In contrast, engineers are interested in issues to do with realizing the project. These include practical
concerns like cost, durability, structural aspects, environmental aspects, fire regulations, and construction methods. Just as there is a
difference between designing and building a house, so too is there a distinction between designing an interactive product and
engineering the software for it.

# **1.3.1 The Components of Interaction Design**

We view interaction design as fundamental to all disciplines, fields, and approaches that are concerned with researching and
designing computer-based systems for people (see **Figure 1.4**). Why are there so many and what do they all do? Furthermore, how do
the various disciplines, fields, and design approaches differ from one another?

We have already described the distinction between interaction design and software engineering. The differences between interaction
design and the other approaches referred to in the figure are largely down to which methods, philosophies, and lenses they use to
study, analyze, and design computers. Another way they vary is in terms of the scope and problems they address. For example,
Information Systems is concerned with the application of computing technology in domains like business, health, and education,
whereas Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is concerned with the need also to support multiple people working together
using computer systems (Greif, 1988).

# **Is interaction design beyond HCI?**

We see the main difference between Interaction Design (ID) and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) as one of scope. ID has
cast its net much wider, being concerned with the theory, research, and practice of designing user experiences for all manner of
technologies, systems, and products, whereas HCI has traditionally had a narrower focus, being “concerned with the design,
evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena
surrounding them” (ACM SIGCHI, 1992, p. 6). That is one of the reasons why we chose to call our book Interaction Design:
Beyond Human– Computer Interaction, to reflect the wider scope.

What about Human Factors and Ergonomics? We see Ergonomics and Human Factors as having closely overlapping goals
with HCI, being concerned with understanding the interactions among humans and other aspects of a system in order to
optimize human well-being and overall system performance.
